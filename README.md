# üöÄ Smart Scaffolding Generator üöÄ

## ‚ú® The description of business problem to solve 
Every time that a new project start, the development suffers from a significant productivity bottleneck at project creation. Every new application requires developers to manually configure multiple interconnected systems wasting a lot of time due to integrate basic structures and configurations and basic structure for web application and mobile app. During this stage each dev team can leverage different solution to address the same problem and some time there is quality decrease and a huge time consuming operations.


### ‚öôÔ∏è The description of the solution
The platform delivers a substantial acceleration in the software development lifecycle, enabling ELCA to move rapidly from initial concept to a first skeleton plug and play. By automating the repetitive scaffolding and configuration steps, development teams can focus on business logic and innovation rather than spending valuable time on setup tasks.
All generated applications adhere to strict quality and compliance standards, automatically applying ELCA-approved best practices, clean code principles, and scalable architectural patterns designed to ensure long-term maintainability and consistency across projects.
The platform is highly versatile, supporting in a long term a wide range of technologies including Java Spring Boot with OAuth2 for secure backend services, Angular for modern web frontends and relational databases for reliable and optimized data management.
In addition to its technical foundation, the platform comes pre-equipped with enterprise-grade infrastructure components. This includes pre-configured CI/CD pipelines and containerization.
The system introduces a workflow that allows teams to interact via a guided wizard exposed by the platform to generate skeleton plug and play in the Elca ecosystem (OKD, Jenkins, Artifactory ...).
